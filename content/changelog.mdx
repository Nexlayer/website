## Clearer Feedback During Deploys

When something goes wrong, feedback is easier to understand — helping your coding agent fix issues instead of guessing.

## More Trustworthy Deploy Results

What you deploy now accurately reflects your latest code changes across build, runtime, and networking.

## More Reliable App Access

Live apps resolve and load more consistently once deployed.

### What this means for you:

- Less debugging by trial and error
- More confidence that what you ship is what's running

## Smoother App Updates

Updating running apps became more dependable across the Nexlayer platform when pushing changes from your coding agent.

## Better Handling of Longer Deploys

More complex or longer deployments now complete more reliably without manual intervention.

### What this means for you:

- Faster iteration cycles
- Fewer "something feels off" redeploys

## More Predictable Deploys from Your Coding Agent

Deployments triggered from Cursor, Claude Code, and VS Code with Copilot became more consistent end-to-end, with fewer silent failures when shipping new apps.

## Stronger Platform Connectivity

Nexlayer's Coding Agent Connector became more reliable during deploys, reducing disconnects and unnecessary retries.

### What this means for you:

- First deploys succeed more often
- Less retrying, fewer restarts
