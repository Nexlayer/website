Assign tasks directly to the Nexlayer Agent, and it will automatically interpret the issue, identify the correct repository, and begin working on a solution. With Nexlayer, engineers can confidently delegate well-defined tasks to the agent and stay focused on high-impact, complex projects.

You can monitor the agent's reasoning step-by-step or simply review the final summary once the task is complete. When you're ready, open the generated changes, review the code, and convert them into a pull request — all in a smooth, integrated workflow.

These templates allow you to define custom form fields that ensure every request includes the information your team needs to take action immediately.

![It's easy to get started](/images/changelog/easy-to-get-started.png)

## Smart Form Templates are ideal for teams that rely on precise inputs, such as:

- Bug reports requiring reproduction steps, environment details, and expected behavior
- Security incidents that must document severity, timelines, and impact
- IT or HR requests like onboarding, access setup, and new equipment needs

With Nexlayer, you can design forms using flexible fields such as text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, and built-in issue properties like priority, customer tags, and labels. Add descriptions for guidance, mark fields as required, and create a streamlined submission experience for every requester.

When users create a new issue, Smart Form Templates appear as intuitive, fillable forms. Anyone in your Nexlayer workspace — even team members submitting requests through Slack — can instantly generate structured, actionable issues, without needing a Nexlayer account.
