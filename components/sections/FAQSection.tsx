        {
          question: "What happens after my 2hr and 30min free deploy ends?",
          answer: "Your app automatically shuts down. Just redeploy if you want to keep testing, or upgrade to Scale for persistent, production-grade execution."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I deploy?",
          answer: "Deploy directly from AI tools via MCP (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) ‚Äî or from your existing pipelines like GitHub Actions, custom CI/CD, or even curl. Nexlayer integrates with your workflow so execution is seamless."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Why $49/mo ‚Äî isn't that cheap for a production cloud?",
          answer: "Yes ‚Äî because Nexlayer is optimized for AI-driven software development. It's built on the same powerful, secure, and scalable orchestration technology trusted by Google, Apple, Spotify, Unity, and Cursor ‚Äî but delivered without the infra complexity of AWS, GCP, or Azure, and without the cost of hiring a team of DevOps engineers or Kubernetes experts. Nexlayer gives that same big-tech execution power to AI builders and startup founders everywhere, regardless of geography."
        },
        {
          question: "What does 'beta' mean for me as a user?",
          answer: "During beta, you get generous execution limits and direct support as we refine Nexlayer with developer feedback. Pricing and features will only get stronger after launch ‚Äî so early adopters lock in the best value."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Is Nexlayer just hosting?",
          answer: "No. Nexlayer is an intelligent execution layer. Hosting platforms keep your code online. Nexlayer connects directly with AI coding tools and CI/CD, normalizes any stack, and executes it instantly in production ‚Äî without cold starts, lock-in, or infra overhead."
        },
        {
          question: "How is Nexlayer different from Vercel, Render, or Railway?",
          answer: "Nexlayer isn't limited to frontends or serverless functions. There are no cold starts, no lock-in, and no framework restrictions. If it builds in a Dockerfile, Nexlayer executes it: APIs, workers, schedulers, WebSockets, or full-stack apps in any language. Or skip containers and connect directly via API strings to services like Supabase or Neon."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I get custom domains?",
          answer: "Yes. Bring your own domains, powered by Nexlayer's native DNS with instant global propagation ‚Äî no external config required."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I manage environment variables and secrets?",
          answer: "Nexlayer doesn't yet provide a built-in secret manager. We recommend securing secrets through your repo or CI/CD provider (e.g., GitHub Secrets, 1Password, Doppler, or Vault). Same best practice used by platforms like Lovable. Our team can guide you if needed."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Where do my apps run?",
          answer: "By default, your applications run on Nexlayer's AI-native Cloud Platform in the US East region. With Nexlayer's native DNS and edge routing, your apps are globally accessible with low-latency DNS resolution. Multi-region deployments and regional selection are available for customers on the Conquer (Enterprise)."
        },
        {
          question: "What about security?",
          answer: "Every app executes in isolated containers with production-grade networking. Enterprise customers can unlock advanced security, compliance, and dedicated resources."
        },
        {
          question: "What if my startup grows fast?",
          answer: "Each application executes independently and scales automatically. For custom AI workloads including GPUs/TPUs needs, multi-region scale, or compliance, you can upgrade to Conquer (Enterprise) and talk to one of our senior Nexlayer Engineers."
